    <desc lang="en">The Maldives: In Extreme Conservation, presenter Michaela Strachan travels the world meeting people battling the effects of climate change, who are intervening in extreme ways to save species or entire ecosystems. In this edition, Michaela is in the Maldives, which is facing an existential challenge from global warming - its picture-postcard sand islands are literally being washed from the map. Research teams from around the world have been invited in to work with local scientists to try to quickly develop solutions before it's too late, and she meets those behind some of the more ambitious projects. Coral reefs are key to protecting the islands from storms and surges, but as the oceans warm, they are being killed off by coral bleaching. Scientists in the Maldives are trying different techniques to resurrect the reefs, from the use of electricity to promote growth to the search for more resilient species. As tourism and the population of the Maldives continue to grow, more land is needed for develop
