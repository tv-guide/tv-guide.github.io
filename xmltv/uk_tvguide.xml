    <desc lang="en">In Belfast, three couples compete to host the best dinner party. Sarah and Paddy kick things off with a fine-dining feast for guests Louise and Danny and Emma and Samson. The hosts mix Eastern and traditional fare. Then, on night two Emma and Samson treat their guests to some Mozambican delights. After a first course that whistles and wows, palates need to be cleansed for the main course, but a chilly chat about ice-cream leaves Louise red in the face. On the final night, Louise and Danny confound everyone's expectations with a sailing-based starter. A spot of model behaviour excites the guests, and a mountain of meringue impresses, but is it enough to win the £1,000 prize?
