    <desc lang="en">Detailing the events of 25 July, 2000, when Air France Flight 4590 crashed shortly after taking off from Charles de Gaulle Airport, Paris, resulting in the deaths of 113 people. Most of the wreckage was consumed by fire, but three mysterious clues were found on the runway - a ruptured fuel tank, some torn pieces of tyre, and a mysterious strip of metal. This documentary made almost 20 years after the event reveals how French investigators used this curious collection of clues to determine the cause. This was the first-ever fatal accident involving a Concorde, the world's only supersonic passenger airliner, but nevertheless led to an immediate cessation of the aircraft's use and ultimately contributed to its withdrawal from service almost four years later</desc>

Goals by Aleksandar Mitrovic, Bobby Decordova-Reid and Willian helped Fulham record a 3-2 win when the sides met in the Premier League at Elland Road in October. They will be hopeful of recording a second victory of the season against United now they have home advantage, but Leeds may see this tie as a welcome distraction from their struggles in the Premier League.
