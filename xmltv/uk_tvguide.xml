    <desc lang="en">A painting depicting the Lebanese city of Beirut arrives at the barn. It was painted by Nonny Jackson-Twist's grandfather just after the Second World War. He would very much like to hang the painting in his home, but it's faded, the canvas cracked and in some sections the paint is flaking away. However, fine art conservator Lucia Scalisi is only too happy to take on this monumental task. Also being restored are pair of silver Shabbat candlesticks and a dilapidated car jack. Presented by Jay Blades

    <desc lang="en">David Olusoga traces the history of an 18th-century sea captain's house near Bristol's docks with links to the slave trade. Bristol was a major port in the transportation of slaves from Africa's Guinea Coast to the Caribbean, and both the man who built the house and its first full-time resident were heavily involved in the trade. David uncovers stories of piracy, abandoned babies, a household slave who made a daring escape from the property, and a protest on the doorstep as the abolitionist movement gained momentum
