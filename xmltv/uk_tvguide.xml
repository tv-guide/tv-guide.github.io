Gary Lineker presents coverage of the final from Wembley Stadium, as the local rivals battle it out for the prestigious trophy. Premier League-winners City claimed a 3-0 win over Championship side Sheffield United in the semi-finals, before United overcame Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on penalties to reach their second Wembley final of the campaign, having already lifted the Carabao Cup. The Citizens prevailed 6-3 when the neighbours met in the league in October at Etihad Stadium, but United gained a measure of revenge with a 2-1 victory at Old Trafford three months later. With analysis from Alan Shearer, Micah Richards and Peter Schmeichel</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Russia has been accused of multiple war crimes in Ukraine since the start of its full-scale invasion. But it was allegations of the illegal deportation of children that led to an international arrest warrant being issued for Vladimir Putin himself. Ukraine says more than 19,000 children have been removed to Russia. Russia maintains that it is evacuating them from danger. The BBC's Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Rainsford has found new evidence of what is happening to Ukraine's missing children and met some of the relatives fighting to get them back.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Ukraine: The Missing Children</title>
    <desc lang="en">Russia has been accused of multiple war crimes in Ukraine since the start of its full-scale invasion. But it was allegations of the illegal deportation of children that led to an international arrest warrant being issued for Vladimir Putin himself. Ukraine says more than 19,000 children have been removed to Russia. Russia maintains that it is evacuating them from danger. The BBC's Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Rainsford has found new evidence of what is happening to Ukraine's missing children and met some of the relatives fighting to get them back.</desc>
