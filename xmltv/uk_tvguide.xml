    <desc lang="en">The teams reach the halfway point and set off on their journey to the fifth checkpoint over 3,000 kilometres away on Manitoulin Island. The race is on but the pairs only have one way out of Churchill - an overnight train south followed by two buses from hell. In what could be the tightest leg so far, the teams have limited options and must use their ingenuity to gain an advantage. The current leaders struggle on with only a quarter of their budget left after splashing out on an expensive taxi in the last leg. Zainib is feeling homesick leaving her and husband Mobeen with a decision to make and Monique and Ladi try to make a quick break from the other teams. Tricia fears she may have to cut her race short after receiving some bad news from home

Starting in the west of Turkey, Michaela discovers that many woodlands are facing devastating losses from climate change and human development. She sees first-hand how fires have destroyed vast areas of pine forest, wiping out the trees, villages and the ecosystem within, including millions of honey bees. Michaela meets bee-loving researcher Yonca Tokbas, who fears that Turkish bees are now being pushed beyond their limit, and who is fighting to retain traditional beekeeping practices before it's too late. Next Michaela journeys to the rugged east of Turkey, where the once-continuous pine forests have become a dwindling patchwork of trees due to human development. She discovers the impact of this change on the wildlife and how the natural behaviours of Turkey's migrating brown bears have been disrupt

    <desc lang="en">Priyanka Chopra Jonas: Priyanka Chopra Jonas never dreamt of becoming famous, but then she won the 2000 Miss World pageant, which provided a 'small-town girl' with a springboard for an international career. But she says she was getting paid 10% of her male co-actor's salary while starring in Bollywood movies, and it's been only during her most recent acting engagement in Hollywood that she has seen the gender pay gap closing for her. In an interview with BBC 100 Women's Yogita Limaye, the Indian actress and producer speaks about her experience with pay parity, body shaming and the pressure social media can bring.
