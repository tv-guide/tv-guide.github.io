    <desc lang="en">The teams reach the halfway point and set off on their journey to the fifth checkpoint over 3,000 kilometres away on Manitoulin Island. The race is on but the pairs only have one way out of Churchill - an overnight train south followed by two buses from hell. In what could be the tightest leg so far, the teams have limited options and must use their ingenuity to gain an advantage. The current leaders struggle on with only a quarter of their budget left after splashing out on an expensive taxi in the last leg. Zainib is feeling homesick leaving her and husband Mobeen with a decision to make and Monique and Ladi try to make a quick break from the other teams. Tricia fears she may have to cut her race short after receiving some bad news from home

    <title lang="en">BBC 100 Women In Conversation</title>

But she says she was getting paid 10% of her male co-actor's salary while starring in Bollywood movies, and it's been only during her most recent acting engagement in Hollywood that she has seen the gender pay gap closing for her. In an interview with BBC 100 Women's Yogita Limaye, the Indian actress and producer speaks about her experience with pay parity, body shaming and the pressure social media can bring.

    <desc lang="en">Ruben and Lewis have dreamt of having a place on the Formula 1 circuit for as long as they can remember. They’ve been racing since the age of four and have won hundreds of trophies between them. This year, they are stepping up a gear and entering a race that could make or break their careers. Breaking into motorsports isn't easy. Motor racing is an exceptionally expensive sport, with annual costs in the tens of thousands just for go-karting – for cars, the sky is the limit. It is also notably lacking in diversity. Those financial and cultural barriers often stand in the way of new drivers coming onto the track. But Ruben and Lewis’s fathers are dedicated to helping their sons achieve their dreams. They, and their families, are prepared to sacrifice everything to help them make it. Now, they are stepping up from racing in go-karts to securing seats in professional race cars. It’s time for Ruben and Lewis to deliver on track, get themselves noticed and do their dads proud.

    <desc lang="en">Priyanka Chopra Jonas: Priyanka Chopra Jonas never dreamt of becoming famous, but then she won the 2000 Miss World pageant, which provided a 'small-town girl' with a springboard for an international career. But she says she was getting paid 10% of her male co-actor's salary while starring in Bollywood movies, and it's been only during her most recent acting engagement in Hollywood that she has seen the gender pay gap closing for her. In an interview with BBC 100 Women's Yogita Limaye, the Indian actress and producer speaks about her experience with pay parity, body shaming and the pressure social media can bring.

In an interview with BBC 100 Women's Yogita Limaye, the Indian actress and producer speaks about her experience with pay parity, body shaming and the pressure social media can bring.
