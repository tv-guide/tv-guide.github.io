In Melrose, Lee and Nadine attend a 40-year-old woman with severe Covid symptoms. She is struggling to walk, and the crew gives her oxygen in the ambulance on the way to hospital.</desc>

The race is on but the pairs only have one way out of Churchill - an overnight train south followed by two buses from hell. In what could be the tightest leg so far, the teams have limited options and must use their ingenuity to gain an advantage. The current leaders struggle on with only a quarter of their budget left after splashing out on an expensive taxi in the last leg. Zainib is feeling homesick leaving her and husband Mobeen with a decision to make and Monique and Ladi try to make a quick break from the other teams. Tricia fears she may have to cut her race short after receiving some bad news from home
